\title{Identifying and extracting representative trees from a random forest}
\usage{
ReprTree(rforest, newdata, metric = "d2")
}
\arguments{
\item{rforest}{A randomForest object}

\item{newdata}{The data on which predictions will be computed}

\item{metric}{The metric to be used to evaluate distance between trees. Currently
only the d2 metric is implemented}
}
\value{
A list object containing representations of the representative trees
   conformable with the \code{tree} class. Names of the list give the indices
   of the representative trees in the set of trees.
}
\description{
This function takes a random forest object and data to run predictions on
and identifies representative trees based on the d0, d1 or d2 metric defined
in Banerjee, et al (2012). Currently only the d2 metric is implemented, using
either a euclidean distance (for numeric predictions) or a mismatch distance 
(for categorical predictions). The average distance D(T) of each tree in the 
set of trees in computed, and trees with the lowest D(T) value are extracted
and formatted to be compatible with the \code{\link{tree}} class. Trees can then
be visualized using \code{plot.tree} and \code{text.tree}, or using a custom
plot function (to be defined)
}

library(randomForest)
library(tree)
rforest <- randomForest(Species~., data=iris)
reptree <- ReprTree(rforest, iris, metric='d2')
